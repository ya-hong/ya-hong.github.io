# Summary

​	The Manchuria established the Qing dynasty and they caused the gap between rich and poor to grow even wider and let much of the country's infrastructure go to seed. At the same time, Europeans wanted to dump goods such as opium to china and led to wars. Chinese lost most of them and forced to sign treaties. The Taiping Rebellion was among the bloodiest civil wars in history, led by a fanatical Christian convert who amassed thousands in the cause to bring down the Manchu as well as many core symbols of Chinese traditional civilization. The rebellion was eventually suppressed after much loss of life and resources, but the Manchu rulers still refused to institute many of the needed reforms that would bring China into the modern age. Anti-foreigner sentiment was its height by the end of the nineteenth century, creating the catalyst for the Boxer Rebellion. Chinese yearning for true reform and Sun Yat-Sen led Xinhai Revolution to end the Qing dynasty. China had experiences similar to Japan and Islamic  civilizations that were impacted by the West during crucial moments that made them to pressures to modernize.
