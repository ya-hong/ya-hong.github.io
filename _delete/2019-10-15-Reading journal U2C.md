# Summary

â€‹	The price of colleges has caused sticker shock. Officials say tuition increases are driven by the universities' costs because colleges are not profit-making enterprises. In fact, academic salaries are the largest budget item,  and the boom in technology has been an added burden, especially for research. Besides, college have to pay higher proportion of student aid. Some researchers note that most of students are not affected by high price-tag tuitions, and institutions charge is still acceptable. However, some colleges are making efforts to trim budgets and pass along the savings. Ultimately, colleges may be able to do only so much to rein in rising tuition.

# Questions for Discussion

1. Should universities charge high tuition fees?

	I think universities should try to charge lower tuition fees. If universities charge high tuition fees, many poor families can't afford to let their child go to college. It's not fair that divide students by their family's wealth. So it is better to charge lower tuition fees. In fact, however, universities have to charge high tuition fees due to many reasons. 

2. What suggestions could be made about seeking better ways to face up to rising tuition?

	I think money can be loaned to students to finish their studies in low interest rate. Because university graduates usually receive higher salaries than those who have lower education, students may willing to borrow a large amount of money.

3. What are the differences between Chinese and American education?

	In my view, Chinese tuition fees are lower than American under Chinese government's support. Besides, China is developing quickly, so education may have larger influence on students' future.
