No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br>Contributor:</p>
<p>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br>    or</p>
<p>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s<br>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br>    Version); or</p>
<p>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br>    its Contributions.</p>
<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>
<p>2.5. Representation</p>

<p>2.6. Fair Use</p>

<h2 id="3-Responsibilities"><a href="#3-Responsibilities" class="headerlink" title="3. Responsibilities"></a>3. Responsibilities</h2><p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code<br>Form.</p>
<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
<p>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
<p>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br>    the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br>License(s).</p>
<p>3.4. Notices</p>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br>jurisdiction.</p>
<h2 id="4-Inability-to-Comply-Due-to-Statute-or-Regulation"><a href="#4-Inability-to-Comply-Due-to-Statute-or-Regulation" class="headerlink" title="4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation"></a>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h2><p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<h2 id="5-Termination"><a href="#5-Termination" class="headerlink" title="5. Termination"></a>5. Termination</h2><p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br>Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br>2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br>prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
